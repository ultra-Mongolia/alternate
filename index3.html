	<p>alternative universe is an enormous, infinite consciousness that imagines the entire hierarchy of narrative layers into existence, and the entirety of the Everything takes place in its mind, including the realm of the True Authors. The realm of the True Authors is unaffected by a cosmology which is infinite levels of uncountable infinite above a realm that transcends dimension. It is impossible for any entity or narrative to reach Universe Prime or even influence its contents, nothing one thing in creation is above Universe Prime. Any seemingly successful attempt to reach or influence alternative universe instead only influences a lesser narrative reality produced by the imaginers of Universe Prime.</p>
